# implement-story - per-task implementation loop for one story

This loop takes **one story** (e.g. "Hello World Endpoint", story `1.0`) and drives it to
completion. Each iteration implements **exactly one** pending task, verifies it against
its spec, runs the relevant quality-gate skills, and records progress. The loop
re-schedules itself until the whole story is ✅ Complete.

The navigation chain it follows every iteration:

```
docs/roadmap/{NNNN}-{milestone-slug}/plan.md          → find the story in ## Stories
        └─ status.md                                   → gate on ## Current status
              └─ {TT.t}-{story-slug}/README.md          → read ## Tasks queue
                    └─ {NN}-{task-slug}.md               → the spec for THIS iteration
```

---

## Argument

`<story>` identifies which story to drive. Accepted forms (most specific wins):

- `0001/1.0` or `0001 1.0` - explicit milestone + story number.
- `1.0` - story number only; resolve the milestone by scanning every
  `docs/roadmap/{NNNN}-*/plan.md` `## Stories` table for that number.
- `"Hello World Endpoint"` - story name; matched (case-insensitive, substring) against the
  `Name` column of the same tables.

If the argument matches zero or more than one story, **stop** and ask the user to
disambiguate - do not guess.

**Number → folder mapping:** a story number `T.t` maps to the folder prefix `{TT.t}`
zero-padded to two digits before the dot: `3.2 → 03.2`, `6.1 → 06.1`, `8 → 08.0`. The
matching story folder is `docs/roadmap/{NNNN}-{milestone-slug}/{TT.t}-{story-slug}/`.

---

## Per-run state cursor (token-economy core)

This loop re-fires into the **same growing conversation**, so anything the main loop reads
directly stays in context for *every* subsequent iteration. The milestone path, story folder,
and task queue do **not** change within a run - reparsing the ~500-line `plan.md` and
~150-line `status.md` each wakeup would add ~10k tokens of pure rediscovery per iteration.
Instead, resolve once and persist a small cursor:

```
.claude/state/implement-story-{story-slug}.json
```
```json
{
  "milestone_path": "docs/roadmap/0001-working-implementation",
  "story_number": "1.0",
  "story_name": "Hello World Endpoint",
  "story_folder": "docs/roadmap/0001-working-implementation/01.0-hello-world-endpoint",
  "task_heading": "## Tasks",
  "task_queue": [
    {"nn": "01", "slug": "config-model", "status": "complete"},
    {"nn": "02", "slug": "...", "status": "not_started"}
  ],
  "next_index": 1
}
```

The cursor is a **derived cache**, not the source of truth: the story `README.md` and
`status.md` remain authoritative. Refresh the cursor only when a task closes (Step 7).
`{story-slug}` is a filesystem-safe slug of the `<story>` argument.

## Iteration algorithm

### Step 1 - load or build the run cursor

Check for the cursor file.

- **Warm path - cursor exists:** read it (~300 tokens) and go straight to Step 3. Do **not**
  re-read `plan.md`, `status.md`, or the README - they are already distilled into the cursor.
- **Cold path - no cursor (first iteration, or it was deleted):** do the discovery **inside a
  cheap subagent**, not in the main loop, so the large file bodies never enter the persistent
  conversation context. Spawn an `Explore` agent (Haiku-tier) with this instruction:

  > Resolve story `<story>` for the implement-story loop. (1) In each
  > `docs/roadmap/{NNNN}-*/plan.md` `## Stories` table, find the row matching the story number or
  > name; record milestone path, story number `{TT.t}`, and name. Number→folder: pad to two
  > digits before the dot (`3.2 → 03.2`); resolve `…/{TT.t}-{story-slug}/`. (2) In that
  > milestone's `status.md` `## Current status` table, read the story row's Status cell. (3) In
  > the story `README.md`, find the task table (heading `## Tasks`, or legacy
  > `## Task overview`) and list each task's `{NN}`, slug, and status.
  > **Return ONLY** a JSON object: `{milestone_path, story_number, story_name, story_folder,
  > task_heading, status_gate, task_queue:[{nn,slug,status}]}`. No prose, no file bodies.

  Branch on the returned `status_gate`:
  - `⬜ Not started` / `🔶 In progress` → write the cursor (`next_index` = first pending
    task) and continue to Step 3.
  - `✅ Complete` → do **not** re-implement. Spawn `task-verifier` against the story folder,
    report its verdict, and **stop** (do NOT reschedule). A completed story is verified, not rebuilt.
  - Argument matched zero or >1 story → **stop** and ask the user to disambiguate.
  - No decomposed folder / no README → **stop**: this loop drives a decomposed story.
  - Missing `status.md` (milestones 0002-0004) → the agent returns `status_gate: "absent"`;
    treat as `⬜ Not started` and proceed (the table is created in Step 7).

If the main loop ever needs a single field it doesn't have, prefer a narrow `grep` of one row
(e.g. `grep -n "^| 3.2 " <status.md>`) over a full `Read` of the file.

### Step 2 - pick the next pending task

From the cursor's `task_queue`, choose the **first** task whose status is `🔶`/Partial,
else the first `⬜`/Not started. Partial is prioritised: unfinished work carries higher
regression risk than new work. Record its `{NN}`, slug, and spec path
`{story_folder}/{NN}-{task-slug}.md`.

If every task is `✅ Complete` (or deferred per the Step 7 completion rule), jump straight
to Step 7 to close the story.

Read **only the chosen task spec** in full - it is the authoritative brief for this
iteration (Files, symbols/fields, validators, tests, success criteria, constraints). This is
a *different* file each iteration, so it is necessary cost, not repeated cost.

### Step 3 - implement via the dev-fleet agents

Delegate the task spec to the appropriate fleet agent. Independent units within one
task may run concurrently; units with stated ordering dependencies run sequentially:

| Spec role keyword  | Fleet agent                             | Agentic action               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `Architect`        | `app-architect`                         | evaluate design               |
| `Python Expert`    | `python-expert`                         | task implementation           |
| `Testing Expert`   | `testing-expert` then `python-expert`   | QA then fix regressions       |
| `Security Auditor` | `security-auditor` then `python-expert` | advisory then implementation  |
| `Docs Writer`      | `docs-writer` or `docs-updater`         | write or update docs          |

Brief each coder/QA agent with **paths and section references, not pasted file bodies** -
pasting a spec bills it twice (once in your context, once in theirs):

- The task spec **path** (`{story_folder}/{NN}-{task-slug}.md`) - the agent reads it itself. Add a one-line scope note, not the spec text.
- The cross-cutting rules in `@docs/dev/python_coding_standard.md` - full annotations, ruff,
  RAII, this project's log-redaction mechanism (if it has one), no bare `except:`, unit +
  mocked-integration tests.
  ModelCompass adds its own cross-cutting conventions on top of the coding standard:
  - `AGENTS.md`:
    - "Architectural Dependency Rules" - `domain/` imports no LiteLLM/Typer/Rich/HTTPX/SQLite.
    - "Test Categories" - `unit`/`mock`/`integration`/`live`/`slow` markers under `--strict-markers`.
    - "Prohibitions" - `Decimal` for money, no persisted or logged secrets, no directories at import time, no network or secrets in mandatory tests, no weakened ruff/mypy/coverage config.
    - "Implementation Rules" - 90% branch coverage, docs updates, live-payload regression fixtures.
  - `CLAUDE.md` "Invariants to preserve" - tri-state `SupportStatus`, preserved unknown price keys, injected `now_utc`.

  The project has no logging or redaction utility (no `logging` usage in `src/`), so secret hygiene relies on never placing keys in messages or stores. If the milestone's `plan.md` carries its own cross-cutting
  guidelines section, name it for the agent to read.

**Return discipline (keeps the parent context lean):** instruct every spawned agent to return
a **compact structured summary** - files changed, symbols added, pass/fail, coverage delta -
and to **never echo diffs, file contents, or full test logs**. A subagent's internal reads and
reasoning are discarded with its context; only its final message persists in the loop, so that
message is the only thing you pay to carry forward.

**Security-sensitive tasks** (auth middleware, anything parsing untrusted or
attacker-influenced input, external-service credentials or tokens): spawn `security-auditor`
**before** coding begins. It reads the spec and writes a threat model to
`docs/security/<date>-<topic>.md`; the coder picks that up as an additional input. A CRITICAL
finding blocks merge - stop the loop and require human sign-off.

### Step 4 - stop-and-ask when implementation needs a decision

During implementation the loop **may pause to ask the user** whenever the spec is ambiguous,
a design choice materially shapes the final implementation, or a deviation from the spec
looks warranted. Use `AskUserQuestion` with concrete options, apply the answer, and
continue the same iteration. Prefer asking to guessing for anything that is expensive to
reverse. (Routine, unambiguous implementation does **not** pause - only genuine forks.)

### Step 5 - verification gate

Run **only this task's** verification, not the whole suite: scope `pytest` to
the task's own test file(s) and use `-q` (capture the summary line, not per-test `-v` output),
plus `python .claude/hooks/style_fixes.py --check <path>`. Do **not** pipe full pytest output into context -
a green run is one summary line; on failure, tail only the failing assertions. The full suite
runs once at story completion (Step 7), and the Stop hook gates the session end regardless.

On failure:

- Diagnose, delegate the fix to `python-expert`, re-run. Repeat until green or until the
  failure is clearly a spec ambiguity needing human input - in that case stop the loop and
  surface the blocker.

### Step 6 - spec-compliance gate (`/verify-task`)

With verification green, run `/verify-task {task-path}` where `{task-path}` is the
spec path from Step 2 (relative to `docs/roadmap/`, without the `.md` extension). It spawns
`task-verifier` for a compliance matrix + verdict:

- **PASS** → record a **single line** (`✓ verify-task PASS`), not the full matrix - the
  matrix only earns its tokens when there is something to act on. Continue to Step 7.
- **PARTIAL** → log the deviation list (this is worth carrying); continue, and feed those
  deviations into the `/pr-review` context so the reviewer sees them.
- **FAIL** → delegate the blocking gaps back to `python-expert` (max 1 retry), re-run
  Step 5 then this step. If still FAIL after one retry, surface the gaps and stop the loop.

Then run the applicable quality-gate skills. **Skip any gate whose trigger condition is false -
do not spawn an agent that can only find nothing.** Each gate is module-scoped, never tree-wide:

| Condition                                                | Skill                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Always                                                   | `/test-gap src/model_compass/<task-module>/` - report coverage delta; if < 85 % delegate missing tests to `testing-expert`. |
| `pyproject.toml` or any `requirements*.txt` changed      | `/dep-audit`                                                                                                                         |
| Any file under an API route, auth, or middleware path changed, or anywhere handling credentials/tokens | `/secret-scan src/model_compass/<changed-module>/` |
| Task touches docs / public API                           | `/link-check docs/` - inbound references still resolve.                                                                              |

### Step 7 - record the task, then check the story

**After each task completes:**

1. Edit the story README `{story_folder}/README.md` - set **only this task's** row Status
   cell to `✅ Complete` (or `🔶`/deferred with a one-line note if only partially done). A
   targeted row edit, not a rewrite.
2. **Refresh the cursor** (`.claude/state/implement-story-{story-slug}.json`): update
   this task's `status` and advance `next_index`. This keeps the next iteration on the warm
   path - it never has to re-read the README.

**Then test the story-completion condition** over the cursor's `task_queue`:

> The story is **✅ Complete** when the feature is overall created and working - even if 1-2
> **minor** tasks are explicitly deferred. Do not block completion on optional or
> enhancement tasks (e.g. a caching optimization) once the core feature is delivered and
> green. A *major* task still `⬜`/`🔶` means the story is **🔶 In progress**, not complete.

- **Story not yet complete** → go to Step 8 (reschedule for the next task).
- **Story complete** → this is the **one** place the whole suite runs: execute
  `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -q --cov=model_compass` once (summary line only), then run
  `/pr-review` (must reach LGTM or have REQUEST_CHANGES resolved). Then update
  `{milestone_path}/status.md` `## Current status` with a **targeted row edit**:
  - Set the story row's Status cell to `✅ Complete` (note any deferred tasks inline,
    e.g. "✅ Complete (task 11 deferred)").
  - Update the Tests cell with the test files introduced.
  - Append/extend the `## Story N - <Name>` summary paragraph: what was delivered, key
    implementation decisions, coverage numbers, and any deferred items.
  - Run `/link-check docs/roadmap/` to confirm the edits keep every link/anchor resolving.
  - **Delete the cursor** `.claude/state/implement-story-{story-slug}.json` (the run
    is over; a stale cursor would mislead a future invocation).
  - **Stop** (do NOT reschedule) - the story is done.

### Step 8 - reschedule

Call `ScheduleWakeup` with:

- `prompt`: the literal `/loop implement-story <story>` (the **same** `<story>` argument).
- `delaySeconds`: `270` - under the 300 s prompt-cache TTL, so the cached prefix (system
  prompt + this loop file + `CLAUDE.md`) is reused at ~10× lower cost on the next wakeup.
- `reason`: "advancing to next pending task of story {TT.t} <Name> after completing
  task {NN}".

> Cache caveat: a heavy `python-expert` step that runs longer than ~5 min blows the TTL
> regardless, so the warm cache mainly benefits the fast gate/verify iterations. The cursor
> (not the cache) is what guarantees cheap rediscovery; the cache is a bonus on top.

## Story-specific notes

Most stories need nothing here - Steps 3-6 already cover the general case. Add a
`### Story {TT.t} - <Name>` subsection only when a specific story carries a real gotcha future
iterations must not rediscover from scratch: a non-obvious ordering dependency between its
tasks, a security-sensitive subsystem that always needs `security-auditor` before coding
starts, an artifact category (generated code, vendored fixtures, build output) that should
skip the usual lint/typing gate, or a dependency that must land before a task can pass.
Keep each note to what the next iteration needs to act correctly on - not a running
commentary on the story.

---

## Token-economy invariants

Because the loop re-fires into one growing conversation, the cost that compounds is whatever
**permanently lands in the main-loop context**. Hold these every iteration:

1. **Resolve once, cache forever (per run).** Steps 1-2 read the cursor (~300 tokens), never
   re-parse `plan.md`/`status.md`/README. Cold-start discovery happens *inside a subagent* so
   the file bodies never enter the persistent context.
2. **Read narrow.** Grep single rows / `offset`+`limit` to a table; never full-`Read` a large
   doc from the main loop. Full reads of the *current task spec* are the only exception
   (necessary, and a different file each time).
3. **Delegate, then demand terse returns.** Push reads, analysis, and reasoning into subagents
   (discarded with their context); require compact structured summaries back - no diffs, file
   bodies, or full test logs. `verify-task` PASS = one line.
4. **Run the minimum gate.** Task-scoped tests with `-q`; full suite once at story close;
   skip any quality gate whose trigger is false; module-scope the ones that fire.
5. **Keep narration terse and lean on `/compact`.** A status line, not a recap - the main
   loop's "thinking out loud" persists; a subagent's does not. On a long story, `/compact`
   between iterations resets the accumulated tail.

## Termination conditions

| Condition                                           | Action                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Target story reaches `✅ Complete` (Step 7)         | Update status.md, print summary, do NOT reschedule |
| Story already `✅ Complete` at Step 1               | Run `task-verifier`, report, do NOT reschedule  |
| Argument matches zero or >1 story                   | Stop, ask the user to disambiguate           |
| Verification fails after the fix retries (Step 5)   | Surface the blocker, stop the loop           |
| `task-verifier` FAIL after one retry (Step 6)       | Surface blocking gaps, stop the loop         |
| `security-auditor` issues a CRITICAL finding        | Stop the loop, require human sign-off        |
| `/pr-review` returns REQUEST_CHANGES after 2 rounds | Stop the loop, surface the diff              |

## Loop ↔ skill relationship

This loop is the **sentence**; the skills are its **vocabulary**. It calls `/verify-task`
(spec compliance), `/test-gap` (coverage), `/dep-audit`, `/secret-scan`, `/link-check`, and
`/pr-review` at the right checkpoints, and delegates implementation to the dev-fleet agents
listed in `agent-orchestrator.md`'s roster. One level up,
[implement-milestone.md](implement-milestone.md) drives a whole milestone by executing this
loop's Steps 2-6 per iteration with milestone-scoped overrides (see its composition
contract); this file remains the authority on all per-task mechanics.
